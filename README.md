# bstmapcbe
In this python code, I connected almost 60+ places in Coimbatore using a Binary Search Tree 
When you type the code for the destination place, it shows the links from the current location (which is fixed as Peelamedu) to the specified destination
PS:Implementation of a map can be done through several easier ways but this I made to practice the tree data structure using a complex real life application(This works in Offline)
